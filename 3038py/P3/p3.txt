turnin code:  py_p3


Write a python3 module named
    p3mod.py
which can be imported and used as in the sample p3main.py program.

The module should provide the function named
    find_starts
which receives a DNA string to analyze.
That function *must* be implemented as a generator which can in turn use
additional generators or generator-expressions if you wish.

The program should analyze each input line and print out information about
each valid start codon found, and where each is located (relative to 0).

Valid start codons are 'atg' and 'gtg'.
Input may be in either upper or lower case.

To test, I will run p3main.py multiple times with various inputs.
Each test will import your p3mod.py module.
Each test will be run in this manner:

    python3 p3main.py some_input_filename

If the input file contains these lines:

    s1   catgccccgtgaaaa
    stwo ccgtgccccctgaaa
    s3   ccctgccccctgaaa

then, the program would print:

    s1 ('atg', 1) ('gtg', 8)
    stwo ('gtg', 2)
    s3

Use turnin to submit only your python source file.
