turnin code: py_p5


Write a python program that takes 4 command-line arguments.
The arguments are:
    
    hash type (from hashlib)
    number of digits in nonce 
    number of leading 0's in result hash
    string to create hash for

A valid invocation would be:

    python3 p5.py  sha256  6  5  harry_potter

The program should comupute all valid nonces of the specified length.
Each digit of the nonce will be a base 10 digit (0-9).
For each nonce, compute the concatenation of the nonce and the string,
and compute a hash for the concatenated string.
If the number of digits in the nonce is 3, then there will be 1000
nonces, 000-999.  Thus, you would compute 1000 hashes.

Count the number of hashes that begin with the correct number of 0's.

The hashlib module's hash facilities and *hexdigest* should be combined and
used to compute the required hashes.

The module named itertools has facilities that may be useful in computing
the nonces.

The program should print the string on a single line, followed by
each nonce and the hash produced from the nonce and string concatenation.

A run like this one:

    python3 p5.py sha1 4 3 ok

would produce output like this:

ok
    2103 00062c1af57faf045ced30628bc71062ebec141d
    3381 00096e31025d03cfcf0bd14df65f6985af62fd38
    3428 000c03a1c3d2e784eb49f885f22204765438eb88
