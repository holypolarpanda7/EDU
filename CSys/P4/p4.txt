turnin code:  cs_p4


Write a program that forks one process.  Have the new process execve the
program named /usr/bin/bc.  Use dup/dup2 and pipes to establish a way
for the original process to pass stdin to bc, and to capture its stdout.

BE SURE TO HAVE THIS AS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE LINE IN *BOTH* PROCESSES:

    alarm(60)

The original process should read lines of input from a file named as the
first command-line arg.  Subsequent command-line args should be handed
to bc as if they were entered on its command-line; there will be no more
than 3.

Each line should be handed to the bc process on its stdin via a pipe,
the line of input printed, and output (if any) printed like this:

    in: line_of_input_from_file
    bc: output_printed_by_bc  # this may be 0 or several lines
    blank_line  ## print a blank line here

Note that bc will not always print something, e.g. it will not reply to:

    a = 0

The select system call can be useful to determine if data is available
on a descriptor.  Do not pause more than 1 second for data here.


I will run tests by typing commands like this:

    ./p4 infilename1
    ./p4 infilename2 -l  # the -l will be passed as arg to bc


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p4dir:
	tar cvf p4.tar ./p4dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p4
        rm -f *.o
        make
