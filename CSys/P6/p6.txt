turnin code:  cs_p6


Create a makefile that builds 2 items when the user simply types:
    make

First, build a shared object named  p6.so  which contains a function that
can be dynamically linked or loaded:

    double timestamp()

Second, build a program named  p6  which takes command-line arguments.
The number of command-line args may vary from 2 to 4 inclusive, e.g.:

    ./p6  libname funcname [arg1] [arg2]

where [ ] indicates that arg1 and arg2 are optional.

p6 should dynamically load func from the library named libname and invoke
it with the given arguments.  You may assume that LD_LIBRARY_PATH will be
set prior to execution of p6 if necessary.

Sample executions:

    ./p6  libm-2.24.so   sqrt 4.0

    ./p6  libm-2.24.so   pow  4.0  2.0

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
    ./p6  p6.so  timestamp


libm-2.24.so is in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ and is what most symlinks point
to there for the math library.


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p6dir:
	tar cvf p6.tar ./p6dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p6
        rm -f *.o *.so *.a
        make
